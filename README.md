# T-pdil_Interpreter
TÜPDİL is a Python-based interpreter for a simplified Turkish programming language. It reads code from input.tup, performs compile-time validation, executes the program line by line, and writes all results to output.txt. The interpreter includes a custom execution engine, a type system supporting integers, real numbers, and text values, basic arithmetic operations using Turkish keywords, variable assignments, and a jump mechanism similar to a goto statement. It detects both compile-time and runtime errors, including invalid syntax, undefined variables, type mismatches, out-of-range jumps, and invalid arithmetic expressions. Compile-time errors stop execution before running the program, while runtime errors halt execution at the faulty line. Although the entire implementation is contained in a single Python file, it imitates the behavior of real interpreters by performing syntax checks, type analysis, and controlled execution flow. The project demonstrates language design, expression evaluation, static checking, and error handling within a Turkish-themed toy programming language.
